/**
 * NonceManager — atomic sequence-number reservation for Stellar accounts.
 *
 * Consolidates three diverging implementations:
 *   - vero-core-engine/engine-bridge/src/nonce-manager.ts
 *   - vero-relayer-service/src/relayer/nonceManager.js
 *   - ad-hoc handling in vero-guardian-dashboard
 *
 * Known bugs in those implementations this class fixes:
 *   - vero-core-engine#164  check-then-act race in reserve()
 *   - vero-core-engine#183  refresh() bypasses the per-account lock
 *   - vero-relayer-service#198  cached sequence served from inside the lock
