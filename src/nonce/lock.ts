/**
 * Per-account async mutex for nonce reservation.
 *
 * Addresses the check-then-act race documented in:
 *   - vero-core-engine#164  (reserve() race)
 *   - vero-core-engine#183  (refresh() bypasses the per-account lock)
 *   - vero-relayer-service#198 (cached sequence inside the lock)
 *
 * Design goals:
 *   - Keys are arbitrary strings (Stellar public keys in practice).
 *   - Different keys run in parallel; the same key serialises callers FIFO.
 *   - The lock is always released, even when the callback throws.
 *   - An optional acquisition timeout rejects with a VeroError rather than
 *     hanging forever, without leaving the lock held for the next waiter.
